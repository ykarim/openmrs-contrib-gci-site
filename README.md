# Description
This project is made to cater to the upcoming new participants and help them familiarise with OpenMRS as well as Google Code-In. This website can be a great resource for new students and will act as a prerequisite for the participants. The website will give complete information about the contest along wtih sources, tips and all necessary details for outsiders as well as students.

#### Key Features
- Guide newcomers to GCI
- Work as a contact page as well as redirect to IRC, Telegram or Talk
- Display information about the OpenMRS GCI tasks and more information about completing them
- Display information about mentors

# Google Code-In 2018
This project was started in GCI 2018 through designing UIs. It was further continued to fully build and setup the website.

Many of the previous students continued their support and help the website come together.

# Development
We use Github itself to track issues and monitor project development. Refer to this link to view all issues and project summary: [GCI Website Issues](https://github.com/ykarim/openmrs-contrib-gci-site/issues)

To get started contributing, check out [OpenMRS Pull Request Tips](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Pull+Request+Tips). 

### Code Style
The coding conventions used by OpenMRS are outlined [here](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/JavaScript+Conventions).

# Getting Started
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

:pushpin: You will need Node v6+ and NPM v6+ installed to successfully build and run.

#### Git

Install the version control tool [git](https://git-scm.com/) and clone this repository with

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/ykarim/openmrs-contrib-gci-site.git
```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
